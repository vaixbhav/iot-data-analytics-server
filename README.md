# IoT Data Analytics & Concurrent Client Handling Sever
Java program to simulate an IoT analytics server which received sensor data and provided various services to clients such as notification, aggregation, and predictive modelling. Through socket programming, the handling of concurrent clients was ensured while maintaining principles of Quality of Services (QoS). Event handling was implemented using a Earliest Deadline First (EDF) approach to optimize client satisfaction.

Implemented a serverless application running on **AWS Lambda**.`template.yaml` is the config file for the **Lambda** function that specifies the **ReST API path** : `\lmbdafn`, and the **Handler** : `cpen221.mp3.lambda.Function::handleRequest`.
Then utilized **AWS's** `sam` to build and deploy `mp3-Erling` on AWS. Currently the lambda function is triggered at the endpoint `https://2a9yquga3f.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/default/IoT_Prediction_Overhead/lmbdafn` with a `HTTP GET`  request with three parameters. This endpoint is hit by a `PredictorThread`.
